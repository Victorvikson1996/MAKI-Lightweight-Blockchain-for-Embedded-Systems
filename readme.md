# MAKI Lightweight Blockchain for Embedded Systems

## Overview

This project consists of two main components:

1. **Backend**: Implements the MAKI operation and lightweight blockchain for embedded systems.
2. **Frontend**: Visualizes the metrics collected from the backend operations using React.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Node.js and npm or Yarn

## Backend Setup

The backend consists of Python scripts for Agent A and Agent B, which perform blockchain operations and collect metrics.

### Steps to Run the Backend

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/maki-lightweight-blockchain.git
   cd maki-lightweight-blockchain/backend
   ```
````

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**

   ```sh
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Agents**

   Open two separate terminal windows or tabs.

   In the first terminal, run Agent A:

   ```sh
   python agent_a.py
   ```

   In the second terminal, run Agent B:

   ```sh
   python agent_b.py
   ```

   Ensure that the agents are running and communicating correctly.

5. **Metrics Collection**

   The metrics collected by the agents will be saved in `metrics_agent_a.json` and `metrics_agent_b.json` in the `backend` directory.

## Frontend Setup

The frontend is built with React and visualizes the metrics collected by the backend.

### Steps to Run the Frontend

1. **Navigate to the Frontend Directory**

   ```sh
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Using npm:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

   Or using Yarn:

   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Start the Development Server**

   Using npm:

   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

   Or using Yarn:

   ```sh
   yarn start
   ```

   This will start the React development server on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Docker Setup

You can also run the backend and frontend using Docker and Docker Compose.

### Steps to Run with Docker Compose

1. **Ensure Docker is Running**

   Make sure Docker Desktop or Docker Daemon is running on your machine.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```sh
   cd /path/to/maki-lightweight-blockchain
   ```

3. **Build and Run Containers**

   ```sh
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   This will build and start the backend and frontend services. The frontend will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

After setting up and running both the backend and frontend, you can:

- Monitor the communication and operations between Agent A and Agent B.
- Visualize the metrics collected from the agents on the frontend dashboard.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed.
- Check if the backend scripts are running without errors.
- Verify that the JSON files with metrics are being generated in the backend directory.
- Make sure the frontend is correctly fetching the JSON data from the backend.
